# cognitive_data_analysis
This is an analysis of human cognitive performance score using lifestyle and demographic factors. The analysis investigates the effectiveness of several supervised learning models, Generalized Linear Regression (GLR), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), XGBoost (XGB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF). The dataset used in this analysis includes features from surveys and an outcome generated by AI using these features. The objective is to assess the capability of these algorithms to accurately predict the target variable and to gain insights into their respective strengths and weaknesses in modeling synthetic data. Through the application of cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning, the models are assessed using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (RÂ²). The findings indicate that ANN delivers the highest predictive performance, with GLR closely following, underscoring the importance of exploring a variety of methods for effective model selection and evaluation. The dependent variable is Cognitive_Score where the independent variables are Age, Gender, Sleep_Duration, Stress_Level, Diet_Type, Daily_Screen_Time, Exercise_Frequency, Caffeine_Intake, Reaction_Time, and Memory_Test_Score.
