# Human Cognitive Performance Analysis
This project explores how lifestyle and demographic factors affect human cognitive performance. It uses various supervised learning models — including Generalized Linear Regression (GLR), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), XGBoost (XGB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF) — to predict a synthetic cognitive score.

The dataset includes survey-based features like Age, Gender, Sleep Duration, Stress Level, Diet Type, Screen Time, Exercise Frequency, Caffeine Intake, Reaction Time, and Memory Test Score.

The goal is to compare model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R². After applying cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning, ANN showed the best results, followed closely by GLR.
